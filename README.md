# Pocket Tanks

## Technologies used
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript (JQuery 3.2.1) and Phaser.io for this project.

## Process/approach
My inspiration for this game came from the mobile version of Pocket Tanks. Once I had my idea down, I created a wire frame and created user stories on a trello board. From there, I researched physics engines to use for my projectiles and I discovered Phaser.io. From there, I based my project off of one of their simple examples involving a tank shooting projectiles at targets.

## Future features
Implementing different weapons and assigning different point values to each weapon.
Allowing tanks to move left and right along the terrain.
1 player mode with a computer opponent

## Bugs :(
Tanks do not work perfectly with terrain. Not perfectly responsive. If you hit space before the tanks land, the turrets will bug out.

## Biggest wins and challenges
The randomly generated terrain, implementing it and getting it to semi-work was a big win.
